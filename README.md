Hi, I'm `Yash`. I like building cool things with friends. Right now I'm:
- Learning digital design and trying to put a neural net on an FPGA.
- Working at Helicone.ai and living in SF (say hi! if you're around)!
- Studying computer engineering at [waterloo](https://ece.engineering/)

Before that, I have:
- Shipped semi-viral web apps built using ai apis.
- Written firmware for drones.
- Run linux on lego ev3.
